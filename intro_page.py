The aim of this project is to develop a robust and accurate predictive model for expected goals (xG) in football matches. Expected goals (xG) is a widely used metric in football analytics that quantifies the probability of a goal being scored from a particular shot, based on various factors such as shot location, type of attack, and other contextual variables.
Motivation
An accurate and dependable expected goals model can provide football clubs, coaches, and analysts with a reliable tool for assessing team and player performance by predicting the likelihood of goals scored during a match. Further these models could also assist bettors, fantasy football players, and other stakeholders in making informed decisions based on the expected performance of teams and players.
